          Capabilities may be summarized as follows:
          1. Supervisor capabilities are exposed at the supervisor level to identify the new functionality added to Supervisor. Any supervisor service can have its local set of capabilities that may or may not rely on the supervisor capabilities. If a supervisor service needs an infrastructure change, then a capability to be defined at the supervisor level and then define VC-level capability if VC changes are required.
          2. Supervisor capability can exist independently or depend on Kubernetes versions and/or VC capabilities.
          3. The supervisor capabilities specification defines supervisor-level capabilities and their dependencies (if any) with Kubernetes version and VC capabilities. Each capability will transition through the states enable=false --> enable=true --> (enable=true, activated=false) --> (enable=true, activated=true) --> Deprecate. The enable status is statically set in-house at the time of feature completion, and the activated state is evaluated at runtime during supervisor install and upgrade. To define such a structure, a CRD is helpful and will be extensible for future use cases. Evaluation of the activated state is performed in WCP Service as it is needed to find feature incompatibilities with infrastructure. IaaS controllers will use the activated state to turn on the new functionality.
          4. A static supervisor capabilities file will exist in CSP for component owners to start their feature development, or component owners can also come up with a capability patch managed in their component SCM repository. The CSP build will merge all the documents into a single manifest YAML.
          5. The supervisor capabilities manifest YAML is distributed along with an async release for WCP Service to find feature incompatibilities and evaluate the activated state and then update the state during supervisor install and upgrade.
          A supervisor service would re-release a new patch if one of its local capability runs into issue.
